## Risk classification

<div style="color: gray">
Prohibited Risk: EU AI Act Chapter II <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Article 5</a>
<br>High-Risk: EU AI Act Chapter III, Section 1 <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/6/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Article 6</a>, <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/7/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Article 7</a>  
<br>Limited Risk: Chapter IV <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/50/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Article 50</a>
<p></p>
</div>

<!--info: The AI Act classifies AI systems into four different risk categories. The EU AI Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal risk, each with corresponding regulatory requirements.  
Unacceptable risk (Chapter II, Article 5) includes systems that pose a clear threat to safety or fundamental rights (e.g. social scoring, recidivism scoring) and are banned.  
High-risk systems are delineated in Chapter III, Section 1, Articles 6 and 7, including AI used in sensitive domains like healthcare, law enforcement, education, employment, and critical infrastructure. These must meet strict requirements and conduct conformity assessment practices, including risk management, transparency, and human oversight.  
Limited-risk systems, delineated in Chapter IV Article 50, such as chatbots, must meet transparency obligations (e.g. disclosing AI use).  
Minimal-risk systems, like spam filters or AI in video games, face no specific requirements. -->

* **Limited Risk** (in accordance with the AI Act)
* **Reasoning**: This system falls under Limited Risk classification as it is a conversational AI system that interacts with users for research purposes. The system clearly discloses its AI nature through its interface and provides transparent information about its capabilities and limitations. It does not fall into High Risk categories as it is not used for critical infrastructure, law enforcement, education assessment, employment decisions, or healthcare diagnosis. The system is primarily used for research assistance and information gathering, which requires transparency obligations but not the full compliance requirements of High-Risk systems.

</div>
<!--**Instructions:**  A thorough risk management system is mandated by the AI Act, especially for high-risk AI systems. This section documents the  proactive efforts to ensure the AI system operates safely and ethically. In general in this section you should document all the measures undertaken to make sure that a system operates safely on the market. Example: Consider a facial recognition system used for real-time law enforcement in public spaces. This is categorized as high-risk under the EU AI Act. If developers document the risk that the system might misidentify individuals—particularly among minority groups due to biased training data—they can plan for rigorous dataset audits, independent bias testing, and establish human oversight in decision-making. Without documenting this risk, the system might be deployed without safeguards, leading to wrongful detentions and legal liabilities. Systematic documentation ensures these issues are not only identified but addressed before harm occurs.-->

### Troubleshooting AI Application Deployment

This section outlines potential issues that can arise during the deployment of an AI application, along with their causes, resolutions, and best practices for mitigation.


#### Infrastructure-Level Issues

##### Insufficient Resources

* **Problem**: System performance degradation due to resource constraints during intensive research operations
  - **Symptoms**: Slow response times (>30 seconds), memory errors, disk space warnings, API timeout failures
  - **Root Causes**: Large document corpus processing, concurrent API calls, insufficient RAM for vector operations, disk space exhaustion from logs and cache

* **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Proactive Monitoring**: Implement resource usage dashboards with alerts at 70% CPU, 80% memory, 85% disk usage thresholds
  - **Dynamic Resource Management**: Automatic cache cleanup, temporary file rotation, and vector index optimization when resource limits approached
  - **Query Optimization**: Batch processing for large document sets, progressive loading for vector searches, query complexity analysis with resource estimation
  - **Hardware Scaling**: Recommend minimum 16GB RAM for production use, SSD storage for vector database, dedicated processing cores for API operations

##### Network Failures

* **Problem**: API connectivity issues and network latency affecting system reliability
  - **Symptoms**: Connection timeouts, SSL certificate errors, DNS resolution failures, intermittent API response delays
  - **Impact**: Complete system unavailability, partial functionality loss, degraded user experience

* **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - **Connection Resilience**: Implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s), multiple DNS servers configuration, connection pooling for API efficiency
  - **Network Diagnostics**: Automated connectivity testing every 5 minutes, network path analysis tools, bandwidth usage monitoring
  - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Cached result serving during outages, offline mode with local-only processing, alternative API endpoint configuration
  - **Performance Optimization**: Content compression for API requests, connection keep-alive optimization, regional API endpoint selection

##### Deployment Pipeline Failures

* **Problem**: System deployment and update failures due to environment or dependency conflicts
  - **Symptoms**: Package installation errors, Python version conflicts, missing environment variables, configuration validation failures
  - **Root Causes**: Dependency version conflicts, corrupted virtual environment, missing system prerequisites, configuration drift

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - **Environment Management**: Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployments, automated environment validation scripts, dependency lock files (uv.lock) for reproducible builds
  - **Rollback Procedures**: Maintain previous working environment snapshots, automated rollback triggers on deployment failure, configuration version control with Git
  - **Validation Testing**: Pre-deployment smoke tests, API connectivity validation, configuration integrity checks, dependency conflict detection
  - **Documentation and Logging**: Detailed deployment logs with error categorization, step-by-step rollback procedures, environment setup validation checklists
  - Roll back to the last stable build.
  - Fix pipeline scripts and use containerisation for environment consistency.
  - Enable verbose logging for error diagnostics.-->


#### Integration Problems

##### API Failures

* **Problem**: External APIs or internal services are unreachable due to network errors or authentication failures.

* **Mitigation Strategy**:
<!--:
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff.
  - Validate API keys or tokens and refresh as needed.
  - Log and monitor API responses for debugging. -->

##### Data Format Mismatches

* **Problem**: Crashes or errors due to unexpected data formats such as changes in the schema of external data sources or missing data validation steps.

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 

<!--
  - Use schema validation tools (e.g., JSON schema validators).
  - Add versioning to APIs and validate inputs before processing.-->

#### Data Quality Problems

* **Problem**: Inaccurate or corrupt data leads to poor predictions.
* **Causes**:
  * No data validation or cleaning processes.
  * Inconsistent labelling in training datasets.

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 
<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Automate data quality checks (e.g., Great Expectations framework).
  - Regularly audit and clean production data.-->


#### Model-Level Issues

##### Performance or Deployment Issues

* **Problem**: Incorrect or inconsistent results due to data drift or inadequate training data for the real world deployment domain. 

* **Mitigation Strategy**:

<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Monitoring for data drift and retraining of the model as needed.
  - Regularly update the model -->


#### Safety and Security Issues

##### Unauthorised Access

* **Problem**: Sensitive data or APIs are exposed due to misconfigured authentication and authorization.

##### Data Breaches

* **Problem**: User or model data is compromised due to insecure storage or lack of monitoring and logging of data access. 

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 
<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Use secure storage services (e.g., AWS KMS).
  - Implement auditing for data access and alerts for unusual activity.
  6.1. Delayed or Missing Data-->


#### Monitoring and Logging Failures

##### Missing or Incomplete Logs

* **Problem**: Lack of information to debug issues due to inefficient logging. Critical issues go unnoticed, or too many false positives occur by lack of implementation ofactionable information in alerts. 

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 


<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Fine-tune alerting thresholds and prioritise critical alerts.
  - Use tools like Prometheus Alertmanager to manage and group alerts. -->


#### Recovery and Rollback

##### Rollback Mechanisms

* **Problem**: New deployment introduces critical errors.

* **Mitigation Strategy**: 

<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Use blue-green or canary deployments to minimise impact.
  - Maintain backups of previous versions and configurations. -->

##### Disaster Recovery

* **Problem**: Complete system outage or data loss.

* **Mitigation Strategy**:

<!--
- **Resolution**:
  - Test and document disaster recovery plans.
  - Use automated backups and verify restore procedures.-->
